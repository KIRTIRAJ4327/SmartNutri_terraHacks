This is a mock receipt file for testing the OCR service without Google Vision API.

The OCR service will detect that Google Cloud credentials are not configured
and automatically fall back to the MockOCRService, which returns realistic
receipt data for development and testing purposes.

When you upload any image file through the API, the mock service will return
a sample grocery receipt with items like:
- Bananas Organic
- Bread Whole Wheat  
- Milk 2%
- Coca Cola
- Chips
- Chicken Breast
- Broccoli Fresh
- Orange Juice
- Yogurt Greek Plain
- Apples Royal Gala

This allows full testing of the nutrition analysis pipeline!
