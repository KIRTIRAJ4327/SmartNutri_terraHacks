## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Healthcare costs are skyrocketing.** Poor nutrition choices lead to diabetes, heart disease, and obesity - costing Canada billions annually. Current nutrition apps are boring, generic, and don't drive lasting behavior change.

**NutriScan changes the game** by making nutrition personal, instant, and addictive through gamification psychology.
